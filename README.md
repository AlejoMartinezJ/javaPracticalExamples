genericPriorityQueue:

Task:
implement the class com.placester.main.ThreadSafePriorityQueue as you see fit
- don't use any collections classes from java.util or java.util.collections
- This class must allow dynamic resizing as elements are added.
- do not use any containers from java.util
 
Solution:

class implemented com.placester.main.ThreadSafePriorityQueue
test: com.placester.test

ramdomRollGeneration:
Task:

Implement a 6 sided die with weights on the sides, so that we don't have an even probability distribution,
but it is weighted by a list of weights passed in at construction time After 10k iterations of throwing this die, the results should closely match the desired distribution

Solution:
class implement:  com.placester.main.SixSidedWeightedDie.java
test: com.placester.test
